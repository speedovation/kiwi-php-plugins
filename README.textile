h2. Kineticwing IDE Plugins using PHP

Doc Version : 1.0 IDE Version 2.0.6

This enables us to write plugins in PHP for KineticWing IDE. We're using sockets for this purpose.

KiWiAPI.php contains API functions which lets us connect to IDE and send requests.

We're using "json-rpc":http://json-rpc.org/ based protocols for API and IDE communications.

KiWiExample.php contains few examples to show us how to use the API.

h3. TODO:

*  WIP on PHP parser plugin
*  Link to where you can find more info about available API functions. 
*  Working on more and simple examples
